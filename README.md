### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my coding haven where pixels turn into magic!

- ðŸ”­ **Currently working on:** My graduation project titled "*Study on Few-shot Enhancement for Pneumonia Image Classification and Lightweight Research*". It's expected to be completed around May, after which I'll update the **MedGAN-ResLite** project.

- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning:** 
    - C++
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    - Medical Image Processing

- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with:**
    - Tricks for Improving DCGAN networks
    - Introducing residual connections in DCGAN networks effectively
    - How to Balancing the generator and discriminator when training

- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:**
    - Image classification
    - Image generation
    - OpenVINO model deployment
    - Model pruning

- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** 
    - If you're my classmate, you can find me directly at the dormitory~~
    - If you're my junior, we might meet on campus. 
    - If we haven't met before, you can reach me on my [Zhihu] or [CSDN] profiles.

Feel free to join me in this electrifying escapade as we decode the universe's secrets, one line of code at a time! ðŸ’»âœ¨
